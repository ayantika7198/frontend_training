I am a string about things. Some of those things are more important than others, so I
will <strong>make them strong</strong> to stand out among less spectacular neighbors.

    William Shakespeare's <em>Sonnets</em> consists of 154 poems, each fourteen
    lines long (three
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatrain">quatrains</a>
    followed by a rhyming
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couplet">couplet</a>).
    <strong>Sonnet 18</strong> is perhaps the most famous, and begins like this:

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br>
      Thou art more lovely and more temperate.

        Learnings is the leader in the movement to teach <em>
        technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
        command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
        everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
        Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
        We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who
        can benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more. To
